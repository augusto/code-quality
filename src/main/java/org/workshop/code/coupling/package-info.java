/**
 * Hopefully, this package will contain some examples of low coupling and high coupling
 *
 * The idea is to demonstrate that coupling classes though a protocol makes the coupling higher. And the more logic
 * we leak the more coupling and duplication we'll have.
 *
 * The other point is that if we actually need a protocol, we should try to use an interface rather than the concrete
 * class (nothing new here).
