/**
 * A DTO or TO is a dummy (or anaemic) objects that is used to transport data between processes or
 * applications. The purpose of these objects is to reduce the amount of interactions between
 * applications.
 *
 * A Value Objects are immutable objects that represent themselves, e.g. String, Date, Money.
 * A VO usually wraps basic type to represent something.
 * These objects don't have an identity and may have a rich interface.
